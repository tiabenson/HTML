    <h1>Grown-ish</h1>
    <p>
      My favorite television series is Grown-ish. &nbsp;This is a spin-off from the popoular series Black-ish, which follows the Johnson family finding their ethnic identity while living in an upper-class neighborhood. Grown-ish follows the life of the eldest daughter in the family, Zoey Johnson, as she attends college. &nbsp;<u>She soon realizes that everything will not go as smoothly as she planned.</u>
    </p>

      I love this series because the show addresses the obstacles that many students face in college. &nbsp;<b>As a college junior, I can say that the show's content is pretty accurate.</b> Another reason I love this series is due to the diverse backgrounds of the characters. &nbsp;There is Jewish, African-American, LGBT, and Indian representation. &nbsp;Grown-ish has also become popular in terms of fashion, so it's nice to watch each episode to see the latest trends.
